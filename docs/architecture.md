## Component Structure

```
App
├── InputForm
│   ├── FormField (reusable)
│   └── Form validation (Formik/Yup)
│
└── ResultsDisplay
    ├── IdeaCard
    ├── NoResults
    └── Filtering/Sorting controls
```

## Data Flow

1. User inputs criteria via InputForm component
2. Form data is validated using Formik/Yup
3. On submission, criteria are passed to the parent App component
4. App component uses the filtering utility to filter ideas from the JSON database
5. Filtered results are passed to ResultsDisplay component
6. ResultsDisplay groups ideas by category and renders IdeaCard components
7. User can sort and further filter results

## Key Modules

### Data Storage

All engagement ideas are stored in a structured JSON format with the following properties:
- Unique identifier
- Title and description
- Category classification
- Implementation details
- Budget and complexity ratings
- Target audience information
- Example implementations
- Required resources

### Filtering Logic

The application uses several utility functions to process the engagement ideas:
- `filterEngagementIdeas`: Filters the idea database based on user criteria
- `sortEngagementIdeas`: Sorts the filtered results by relevance, complexity, budget, etc.
- `groupIdeasByCategory`: Organizes ideas into categories for display
- `calculateRelevanceScore`: Computes a relevance score for each idea based on user preferences

### User Interface

The UI is built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, featuring:
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Form validation with error messages
- Card-based results display
- Category grouping of results
- Sorting and filtering options
- Expandable idea cards to show/hide details

## Future Extensions

The architecture supports several planned extensions:
- Backend API integration
- User accounts and saved ideas
- Analytics to track popular ideas
- User-submitted engagement ideas
- Admin panel for content management
